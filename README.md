### What is Agile?

"Early delivery of business value"

#### Most IT Projects Fail.  And are Late.

* IT Project Success Rate 1994: `16%`
  * Average cost & time overrun: `170%`
* IT Project Success Rate 2004: `34%`
  * Average cost & time overrun: `70%`

#### We Tend to Build the Wrong Thing

 * 45% of features *never* get used
 * 19% Rarely
 * 16% ...
 * etc.

#### Big Bang = Big Risk

* *Big Bang* the deliverable comes at the end of a cumulative period of cost
* As *cumulative cost* and *value* increase, so does risk
  * Poor assumptions:
    * The customer knows what they want
    * The developers know how to build it
    * Nothing will change during development

#### Long Projects get Longer

* More likely to interrupt
* More likely to get extended
* More likely to suffer scope creep

#### Agile = Homing Missile

* Good assumptions:
  * Customer will discover what he wants
  * The developers discover how to build it
  * Things keep changing

### The Agile Umbrella

* Scrum
  * Scrumbut
  * Scrumand
* Kanban
* et al

### Iterative & Incremental

* Each jump in value adds risk
* Don't build horizontal increments of code
  * i.e. Increment 1) Create a Schema > 2) Develop an API > 3) Client / UI

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Client</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Server</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Database</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Delivering a Car Incrementally, Horizontally as an Example

 1. Delivered a tire >:(
 2. Delivered a chasis |:(
 3. Delivered a body with a chasis (:|
 4. Delivered a whole car :)

### Vertical Increments

#### Delivering a Conveyance Incrementally, Vertically

1. Skateboard "Need to move" :)
2. Scooter "Need to stay on conveyance" :)
3. Bike "Need speed" :)
4. Motorcyle "Need power" :)

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Client</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Server</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Database</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Keep Your Iterations Short

* Short releases
* Testable
* Clear

### Planning

#### Estimates are Always Wrong

* Estimates in time working out to a "day" are generally closer
* "Anchoring estimates" happens when an expert gives an opinion first

### Velocity Based Release Planning

To know the future, you need to know the past

If we have a backlog of equally sized items; you can determine your velocity by averaging out previous cadences.

### Estimating

#### Features Have Different Sizes

Two ways to deal with size:

1. Ignore it
   1. It evens out over time
   2. Track velocity
2. Rough size
   1. Don't estimate time
   2. Estimate relative size of features
   3. Measure velocity per sprint
   4. Derive release plan
3. (Scrum rule) Estimates are done by people who are going to **do the work**
4. **RE**-estimate regularly
   1. Do not trust early estimates
5. Prefer verbal communication over detailed, written specifications.
6. **Avoid false precision**
   1. Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong
7. Maximize Value, not Output

### The Development Team

* Resource optimization vs Time-to-market optimzation
  * Old way
    * Specialized tasks -> Specialists
  * New way
    * Cross-functional team
      * Colocatd
      * Small (3-7 people)
    * Clear mission and product owner
    * Empowered to deliver
    * Direct contact with users & stakeholders
    * Focused.  No multitasking.
    * Transparent
    * Releasing must be *really* easy
    * The team balances long-term and short-term work

### Succeding with Software Development

#### What have we learned?

Top 5 reasons for success

1. User involvement
2. Executive management support
3. Smaller projects

### The price of agile

* Infrastructure Investments
* Reorganizaton
* New Skills
* New Habits
* Transparency

### Big is Bad



# Agile Manifesto
[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.

### Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

### In Application:

* Satisfy the customer
* Welcome changing requierments
* Deliver working software frequently
* Business people and developers must work together daily
* Motivated individuals build projects; give them the environment, support and trust they need
* Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient way to communicate
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable Development
* Technical excellence
* Simplicity, maxmizing work not done
* Self-organizing teams make the best product
* Reflecting how to be more effective as a team
